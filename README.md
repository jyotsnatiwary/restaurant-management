# restaurant-management
a restaurant management to calculate bill in a restaurant 

THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON C LANGUAGE. IT IS A ONLINE BILLING SOFTWARE THAT TAKES INPUT FROM USER, DISPLAYS THE MENU, ASKS THE USER TO MAKE CHOICE AND FINALLY DISPLAYS THE BILL. THE OLD MANUAL SYSTEM WAS SUFFERING FROM A SERIES OF DRAWBACKS. SINCE WHOLE OF THE SYSTEM HAD TO BE MAINTAINED BY HANDS THE PROCESS OF KEEPING, MAINTAINING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION WAS VERY TEDIOUS AND LENGTHY.
